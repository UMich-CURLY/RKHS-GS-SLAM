# RKHS-GS-SLAM
RKHS GS SLAM is a system that leverages sparse rendering techniques in 3D Gaussian Splatting to efficiently map scenes for robotics applications. It features a non-correspondence registration algorithm alongside a loop closure mechanism to maintain both visual detail and geometric accuracy.
